# HydNet
a program for simulating steady and nonsteady flow in complex pipe networks

Requires Eigen to be compiled or in the src directory. Available at: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org

When running testcases the files should be renamed "nodes" and "elements" respectively and placed in the same directory as the HydNet binary along with the "settings" file.

This code was written as part of an undergraduate thesis: Numerical simulation of steady and unsteady flow in complex pipe networks
The croatian version of the thesis is available at: http://repozitorij.fsb.hr/id/eprint/9145

Currently under construction.
