# HydNet
a program for simulating steady and nonsteady flow in complex pipe networks

Requires Eigen to be compiled or in the src directory. Available at: https://eigen.tuxfamily.org

When running testcases the files should be renamed "nodes" and "elements" respectively and placed in the same directory as the HydNet binary along with the "settings" file.

Currently under construction.
